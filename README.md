$vagrant up
```

In about 4-5 minutes your vagrant machine would be ready to run.

Machine is always running on same IP and under same directory, so if you have developers license,
there should be no issues with licenses IP/Location change, even with multiple developers working on project

Machine is running on <b>192.168.56.101</b> and with hostname <b>whmcs.dev</b>

You will have to add 
```
192.168.56.101 whmcs.dev www.whmcs.dev
```
To your hosts file in order to easily access it from browser.

When your WHMCS code is in place, just follow installation guideline, and in about 30 seconds you should be ready.

```json

    mySQL host: "127.0.0.1"
    username: "whmcs"
    password: "whmcs"
    database_name: "whmcs_db"
    SSH host: "whmcs.dev"
    SSH User: "vagrant"
